			<p>I have been a financial analyst in a Venture Capital in the past.
				I went to <a href="www.esade.edu">ESADE Business School</a> in Barcelona.
				I have always been passionate about technology and learning. After a bunch of
				online courses I ended up in San Francisco at
				<a href="www.appacademy.io">App Academy</a>. It was a
				matter of time for me to fall in love with coding.</p>
			<p class="important-info">Web developer at <a href="www.wuaki.tv">Wuaki.tv</a></p>
			<p>I think <span class="important">Learn To Code</span> has been to most
				important think I have done in my life. That is why I try to teach
				coding as much as I can. I am a teacher at
				<a href="www.ironhack.com">Ironhack Barcelona</a>.</p>
			<p><span class="important">Learn To Code</span> doesn't mean becoming a
				developer. You can use it to perform better at your job.
				You can automotize any mechanic task, you can scrape the web to get
				useful about market or competitors, you can talk and understand the
				developers taht work with you, the possibilities are endless.</p>
			<p><span class="important">Learn To Code</span> is like learning english
				to surf the Internet. When you don't know english, the Internet is
				limited. Once you know english the possibilities on the Internet are
				limitless.</p>
